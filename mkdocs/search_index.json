This process typically will store the token in the session so that you\nmay compare against it in subsequent requests.\n\n\nMost implementations also define a \nrender()\n method (or delegate to one) in\norder to produce a CAPTCHA representation, be it an image, a figlet, a logic\nproblem, or some other CAPTCHA.\n\n\nZend\\Captcha\\AbstractWord\n\n\nZend\\Captcha\\AbstractWord\n is an abstract adapter that serves as the base class\nfor most other CAPTCHA adapters. It provides mutators for specifying word\nlength, session TTL and the session container object to use; it also\nencapsulates validation logic.\n\n\nBy default, the word length is 8 characters, the session timeout is 5 minutes,\nand \nZend\\Session\\Container\n is used for persistence (using the namespace\n\"\nZend\\Form\\Captcha\\\ncaptcha ID\n\").\n\n\nIn addition to the methods required by the \nZend\\Captcha\\AdapterInterface\n interface,\n\nZend\\Captcha\\AbstractWord\n exposes the following methods:\n\n\n\n\nsetWordLen($length)\n and \ngetWordLen()\n allow you to specify the length of\n  the generated \"word\" in characters, and to retrieve the current value.\n\n\nsetTimeout($ttl)\n and \ngetTimeout()\n allow you to specify the time-to-live of\n  the session token, and to retrieve the current value. \n$ttl\n should be\n  specified in \nseconds\n.\n\n\nsetUseNumbers($numbers)\n and \ngetUseNumbers()\n allow you to specify if\n  numbers will be considered as possible characters for the random word, or if\n  only letters would be used.\n\n\nsetSessionClass($class)\n and \ngetSessionClass()\n allow you to specify an\n  alternate \nZend\\Session\\Container\n implementation to use to persist the\n  CAPTCHA token and to retrieve the current value.\n\n\ngetId()\n allows you to retrieve the current token identifier.\n\n\ngetWord()\n allows you to retrieve the generated word to use with the CAPTCHA.\n  It will generate the word for you if none has been generated yet.\n\n\nsetSession(Zend\\Session\\Container $session)\n allows you to specify a session\n  object to use for persisting the CAPTCHA token. \ngetSession()\n allows you to\n  retrieve the current session object.\n\n\n\n\nAll word CAPTCHAs allow you to pass an array of options or a \nTraversable\n\nobject to the constructor, or, alternately, pass them to \nsetOptions()\n. By\ndefault, the \nwordLen\n, \ntimeout\n, and \nsessionClass\n keys may all be used.

It provides a random\nstring that must be typed in reverse to validate. As such, it's not a good\nCAPTCHA solution and should only be used for testing. It extends\n\nZend\\Captcha\\AbstractWord\n.\n\n\nZend\\Captcha\\Figlet\n\n\nThe \nZend\\Captcha\\Figlet\n adapter utilizes \nZend\\Text\\Figlet\n to present a\nfiglet to the user.\n\n\nOptions passed to the constructor will also be passed to the\n\nZend\\Text\\Figlet\n object. See the\n\nZend\\Text\\Figlet\n\ndocumentation for details on what configuration options are available.\n\n\nZend\\Captcha\\Image\n\n\nThe \nZend\\Captcha\\Image\n adapter takes the generated word and renders it as an\nimage, performing various skewing permutations to make it difficult to\nautomatically decipher. It requires the \nGD extension\n,\ncompiled with TrueType or Freetype support. Currently, the \nZend\\Captcha\\Image\n\nadapter can only generate PNG images.\n\n\nZend\\Captcha\\Image\n extends \nZend\\Captcha\\AbstractWord\n, and additionally\nexposes the following methods:\n\n\n\n\nsetExpiration($expiration)\n and \ngetExpiration()\n allow you to specify a\n  maximum lifetime the CAPTCHA image may reside on the filesystem. This is\n  typically longer than the session lifetime.  Garbage collection is run\n  periodically each time the CAPTCHA object is invoked, deleting all images\n  that have expired. Expiration values should be specified in \nseconds\n.\n\n\nsetGcFreq($gcFreq)\n and \ngetGcFreg()\n allow you to specify how frequently\n  garbage collection should run. Garbage collection will run every \n1/$gcFreq\n\n  calls. The default is 100.\n\n\nsetFont($font)\n and \ngetFont()\n allow you to specify the font you will use.\n  \n$font\n should be a fully qualified path to the font file. This value is\n  required; the CAPTCHA will throw an exception during generation if the font\n  file has not been specified.\n\n\nsetFontSize($fsize)\n and \ngetFontSize()\n allow you to specify the font size\n  in pixels for generating the CAPTCHA. The default is 24px.\n\n\nsetHeight($height)\n and \ngetHeight()\n allow you to specify the height in\n  pixels of the generated CAPTCHA image. The default is 50px.\n\n\nsetWidth($width)\n and \ngetWidth()\n allow you to specify the width in pixels\n  of the generated CAPTCHA image. The default is 200px.\n\n\nsetImgDir($imgDir)\n and \ngetImgDir()\n allow you to specify the directory for\n  storing CAPTCHA images. The default is \n./images/captcha/\n, relative to\n  the bootstrap script (typically \npublic/index.php\n, resulting in\n  \npublic/images/captcha/\n).\n\n\nsetImgUrl($imgUrl)\n and \ngetImgUrl()\n allow you to specify the relative path\n  to a CAPTCHA image to use for HTML markup. The default is\n  \n/images/captcha/\n.\n\n\nsetSuffix($suffix)\n and \ngetSuffix()\n allow you to specify the filename\n  suffix for the CAPTCHA image. The default is \n.png\n. Note: changing this\n  value will not change the type of the generated image.\n\n\nsetDotNoiseLevel($level)\n and \ngetDotNoiseLevel()\n, along with\n  \nsetLineNoiseLevel($level)\n and \ngetLineNoiseLevel()\n, allow you to control\n  how much \"noise\" in the form of random dots and lines the image would contain.\n  Each unit of \n$level\n produces one random dot or line. The default is 100 dots\n  and 5 lines. The noise is added twice, both before and after the image\n  distortion transformation.\n\n\n\n\nAll of the above options may be passed to the constructor by simply removing the\n'set' method prefix and casting the initial letter to lowercase: \"suffix\",\n\"height\", \"imgUrl\", etc.\n\n\nZend\\Captcha\\ReCaptcha\n\n\nThe \nZend\\Captcha\\ReCaptcha\n adapter uses \nZend\\Service\\ReCaptcha\\ReCaptcha\n\nto generate and validate CAPTCHAs.  It exposes the following methods:\n\n\n\n\nsetSecretKey($key)\n and \ngetSecretKey()\n allow you to specify the secret key to\n  use for the ReCaptcha service. This must be specified during construction,\n  although it may be overridden at any point.\n\n\nsetSiteKey($key)\n and \ngetSiteKey()\n allow you to specify the site key to use\n  with the ReCaptcha service. This must be specified during construction,\n  although it may be overridden at any point.\n\n\nsetService(ZendService\\ReCaptcha\\ReCaptcha $service)\n and \ngetService()\n\n  allow you to set and get the ReCaptcha service object.\n\n\n\n\nWhen constructing \nZend\\Captcha\\ReCaptcha\n, you can use the same set of keys\nto the \n$options\n array as supported by \nZend\\Service\\ReCaptcha\\ReCaptcha\n.\n\n\nUpdating from v2 to v3 of this adapter\n\n\nAs this adapter takes the same option keys as \nZend\\Service\\ReCaptcha\\ReCaptcha\n which supports Recaptcha API v2, this \ncomponent no longer supports the \nssl\n, \nxhtml\n and \nlang\n keys in the \n$options\n\narray that is passed to the constructor.\n\n\nThe options keys \npubKey\n and \nprivKey\n and the getters and setters for these\nkeys are supported in this version, but are deprecated.",
